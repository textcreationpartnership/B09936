            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Sad, and True RELATION Of ſix Seamen, who ſold themſelves to the <hi>DEVIL.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THough this following Relation, contains matter of very great Wonder and Amazement; Nevertheleſs it comes to our hands, confirm'd by that ſufficient Teſtimony, that we offer it to the Reader, as a Narrative of unqueſtioned Truth and Reputation.</p>
            <p>By a Letter from <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> dated the 23 of <hi>July</hi> laſt, written by a Perſon of Worth and Credit in that Iſland, we have this ſtrange and amazing Relation: That the <hi>Margaret</hi> from <hi>Boſten</hi> the 21 of <hi>December</hi> 1696. Bound to <hi>Barbadoes;</hi> In their Paſſage, one of the Sailors at the Helm, did call unto the Maſter of the Veſſel, and told him, that he could not ſteer no longer; Then the Maſter ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reaſon, he replyed, that he was not well, and for that Cauſe quitted his Poſt. Upon this the Maſter went immediatly and took the Helm; The ſaid Sailor did likewiſe further declare, that there ſtood a Spirit by the Bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, that accuſed him of killing a Woman, a fault which the ſaid Spirit had falſly accuſed him withal, for he never committed any ſuch unmanly Crime in his Life; The Spirit he ſaid, likewiſe further told him, that all the Ships Company had contracted and ſigned an Agreement with the Devil, which was uſed as an Argument, for to entice him to do the ſame.</p>
            <p>The next day after, the Fellow fell into moſt ſtrange <hi>Deliriams,</hi> and talked of wonderfull Accidents that would certainly befall the Ship, the which were looked upon as nothing, thinking this proceeded from the wild Notions of his crazed Senſes, the <hi>Chimera</hi>'s of Frenzy. Particularly he ſaid, That the Spirit had brought a Boat to fetch him away, with other rediculous idle Diſcourſe of that Nature.</p>
            <p>Upon the 17 of <hi>January,</hi> in the Latitude of 19, about 9 at night, a ſmall and white Cloud aroſe, without any Rain or extraordinary Wind, which preſently falling upon the Ship, preſſed her down with ſtrange, and indeed ſupernatural weight and force, that the Hatches flew out, and the whole Ship was under Water, by which unhappy Accident, the Boy was waſht off and drowned.</p>
            <p>But here to begin the more miraculous part of my Narrative, the Ship con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued 11 weeks under water, a thing that ſtruck (as may well be imagined) an extraordinary amazing Conſternation &amp; Confuſion through all the Mariners, from ſeveral ſtrange ſorts of Arguments of their Aſtoniſhment. Firſt, That the Ship it ſhould be ſo wholly immerged under the Water, &amp; yet not to ſink down
<pb facs="tcp:191988:2"/>right to the bottom. Secondly, That though they were apparently thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Water, and yet the Ship was not wholly filled with Water, but that they had Air enough for to breath in, by which great Means they continued alive, and feeding all that while upon Raw Meat, and freſh fiſh, which came ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the Veſſel, and ſeveral of which they eagerly caught and eat: Their Lodging was on Boards and Planks, the which were placed athwart the Rail, near the Taffrel, covered with a Sail. The Men were alwiſe wet, which in ſo long a time, made that impreſſion upon them, that their Fleſh on their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies was galled and raw.</p>
            <p>But what was the moſt amazing and diſmalleſt part of all, was, Six of the Ships Crew, upon the ſinking of the Veſſel under Water, were frighted with Infernal Spirits, and about twelve the very firſt Night, were carried away invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, leaving no more than four Perſons alive behind them; Which indeed gave ſome little and ſmall Credit, to what the forementioned Sailor at the Helm, had declared in his <hi>Deliriums.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this Eleven Weeks immurement in theſe wondrous watery Walls, for ſo I may juſty call it. the Ship recovered her ſelf again, and the firſt Land they could diſcover was the Iſland of <hi>Diffiado,</hi> which, with ſo few hands left, they could not fetch up, by reaſon of a ſtrong Northern Current that bore againſt them, the next was <hi>Grand Terra,</hi> where they met with the ſame diſappointment; But on the fifth of <hi>April,</hi> they run themſelves upon the ſhore upon <hi>Gaurdelopo,</hi> where the <hi>French</hi> treated them very kindly, not as Priſoners.</p>
            <p>The Names of the three Seamen left alive, are, <hi>William Davis</hi> Maſter (a Man very well known in <hi>London</hi> amongſt the <hi>Barbadoe</hi>'s Merchants) <hi>William Cadner,</hi> and <hi>William Bywater.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Note only the Original Letter, and the whole Relation at large, is for to be ſeen at Mr. <hi>Loyds</hi> Coffee-houſe in <hi>Lombard-ſtreet,</hi> where likewiſe ſeveral Perſons are to be heard of, and ſpoken withall u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> in Atteſtation of the whole Truth herein declared.</p>
            <p>The Reverend Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his Treatiſe of Spirits, ſayes, That tho Hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes and Tempeſts have natural Cauſes, yet there is great Reaſon to think they are managed by Spirits. In Confirmation whereof, he hath related ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Notable Inſtances of his own particular Deliverances, from the fury of moſt Boyſterous Whirl-winds. Namely, when the Reapers in <hi>Eveſham</hi> Vale were hurt, writhen, and one killed, Some Friendly Power (for ſo he expreſſes it) reſtrained the Courſe of Gravally Sand, raiſ'd by a Whirl-wind, as it met him in a Narrow Lane.</p>
